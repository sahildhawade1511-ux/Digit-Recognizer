# Digit-Recognizer
An interactive MNIST digit recognizer built with TensorFlow and Gradio.  Train a CNN on the MNIST dataset, then draw digits in your browser to get real-time predictions with top confidence scores.

# MNIST Digit Recognizer with Gradio

This project demonstrates a convolutional neural network (CNN) trained on the MNIST dataset to classify handwritten digits (0â€“9). Using [Gradio](https://gradio.app/), you can interactively draw digits in your browser and get instant predictions with confidence scores.

## Features
- *Model*: TensorFlow/Keras CNN trained on MNIST.
- *Interface*: Gradio sketchpad for drawing digits.
- *Predictions*: Displays top 3 predictions with confidence.
- *Real-time processing*: Preprocessing and prediction happen instantly in the browser.

## How It Works
1. Train the CNN using train.py (or your training script).
2. Save the trained model as my_mnist_model.keras.
3. Run final.py to launch the Gradio interface.
4. Draw a digit and view the predictions in real time.

## Installation
```bash
pip install tensorflow gradio numpy
